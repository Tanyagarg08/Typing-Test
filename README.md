🚀 Project Showcase: Typing Speed Test Game (Python + Tkinter) 🧠⌨️

I'm excited to share a fun and engaging project I recently built — a Typing Speed Test Game developed using Python and Tkinter.

🔹 About the Game:
This interactive desktop application challenges users to type randomly displayed words within a 60-second time limit. It tracks accuracy and calculates your final Words Per Minute (WPM) score based on correct inputs. The game features a real-time timer, dynamic word generation, and live score updates — all wrapped in a clean, responsive GUI.

🔹 Key Features:

⏱️ 60-second countdown timer

🎯 Real-time WPM scoring

🔁 Dynamic word generation

🖱️ Smooth user interaction using keyboard events (Enter/Space)

🖼️ GUI built with Tkinter for a lightweight, responsive experience

🔹 Tech Stack:

Language: Python

GUI Library: Tkinter

This project helped me deepen my understanding of GUI development, event handling, and time-based logic in Python.
